## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Build Fails
**Problem**: Railway can't build your app
**Solution**: 
- Check `requirements.txt` syntax
- Ensure all dependencies are listed
- Check logs for specific error messages

#### 2. App Won't Start
**Problem**: App starts but crashes immediately
**Solution**:
- Check `Procfile` syntax
- Verify `hpo_backend.py` is correct
- Check if `hp.json` is present

#### 3. Memory Issues
**Problem**: App runs out of memory
**Solution**:
- Railway free tier has 1GB RAM limit
- Consider upgrading to paid plan
- Optimize data loading

#### 4. Slow Performance
**Problem**: App is slow to respond
**Solution**:
- Check Railway metrics
- Consider upgrading resources
- Optimize your code

### Debug Commands

#### Check Logs
```bash
# View recent logs
railway logs

# Follow logs in real-time
railway logs --follow
```

#### Connect to Railway CLI
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Connect to your project
railway link
```

## üöÄ Advanced Configuration

### Environment-Specific Settings

#### Development
```toml
[environments.development]
variables = { 
  ENVIRONMENT = "development",
  DEBUG = "true",
  ALLOWED_ORIGINS = "*"
}
```

#### Production
```toml
[environments.production]
variables = { 
  ENVIRONMENT = "production",
  DEBUG = "false",
  ALLOWED_ORIGINS = "https://your-domain.com"
}
```

### Health Checks
Railway automatically checks:
- **Path**: `/health` (defined in `railway.toml`)
- **Timeout**: 100 seconds
- **Retries**: 10 attempts

### Scaling
- **Horizontal**: Add more instances
- **Vertical**: Upgrade to higher tier
- **Auto-scaling**: Available in Pro+ plans

---

## üìà Performance Optimization

### For Railway Deployment

1. **Optimize Startup Time**:
   - Use `start_railway.py` for faster startup
   - Minimize imports
   - Lazy load heavy modules

2. **Memory Management**:
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Use efficient data structures
   - Implement caching

3. **Response Time**:
   - Use async/await properly
   - Implement response caching
   - Optimize database queries

---

## üîí Security Considerations

### Production Security
1. **CORS Configuration**:
   ```python
   # In hpo_backend.py
   app.add_middleware(
       CORSMiddleware,
       allow_origins=["https://your-domain.com"],  # Specific domains
       allow_credentials=True,
       allow_methods=["GET"],
       allow_headers=["*"],
   )
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Never commit secrets to Git
   - Use Railway's environment variables
   - Rotate keys regularly

3. **HTTPS**:
   - Railway provides free HTTPS
   - Always use HTTPS in production
